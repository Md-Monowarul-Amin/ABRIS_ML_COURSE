Here is a well-structured assignment task for building a calculator using Python:

---

### **Assignment Title:** Building a Simple Calculator in Python

---

### **Objective:**

The objective of this assignment is to develop a functional calculator using Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations. This task will help students understand conditional statements, functions, and user input handling in Python.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Design and implement a command-line based calculator in Python that can perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Modular Arithmatic

The program should allow users to enter two numbers and choose an operation. It should display the result and offer the option to perform another calculation or exit the program.

---

### **Requirements:**

1. Create a function for each operation: `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`, `mod(a, b)`.
2. Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs, division by zero).
3. Allow the user to choose the operation from a menu.
4. Use a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user decides to quit.
5. Display appropriate messages and results clearly.

---

### **Sample Output:**

```
Welcome to Python Calculator!
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Mod
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 2
Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15 - 5 = 10

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes

...

Thank you for using the calculator!
Calculation History:
1. 15 - 5 = 10
2. 8 * 2 = 16
3. 20 / 4 = 5.0
